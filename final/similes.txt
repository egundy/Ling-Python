Simile found:  You and the girls may go, or you may
      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for
      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr
Simile found:  Jane was as much gratified
      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way
Simile found: ”

      “If I were as rich as Mr
Simile found: ”

      “That is as it happens
Simile found:  He was as much awake to the novelty of attention
      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously
      closed his book
Simile found:  Wickham was as far beyond
      them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were
      superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing
      port wine, who followed them into the room
Simile found:  In everything
      else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived
Simile found:  Collins’s character, connection, and
      situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness
      with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the
      marriage state
Simile found:  On the contrary, she was as much
      disposed to complain of it as her husband
Simile found:  Elizabeth soon heard from her
      friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as
      it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was
      impossible
Simile found: 

      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as
      impatience generally is
Simile found:  But,
      my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not
      think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her
      behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion
Simile found:  It was dated from Rosings, at eight
      o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—

      “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments
      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to
      you
Simile found: 

      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
      week of her stay as they had been at first
Simile found:  But,
      Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not
Simile found:  We both know that
      he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has
      neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful
      as he is insinuating
Simile found:  He must
      know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
      her
Simile found:  It was as follows:

      “My dear Sir,
      “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are
      now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a
      letter from Hertfordshire
Simile found:  I have seen
      them both—”
          “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are
          married!”

      Elizabeth read on:

      “I have seen them both
Simile found:  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing
      but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
      him to act as he has done
Simile found: 

      “He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr
Simile found:  The dinner was as well dressed as
      any I ever saw
Simile found: ’
