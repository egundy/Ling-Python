abstract
the aim of this paper is to develop a cognitive grammarbased analysis 
of english copyraising cr constructions such as richard seems like he is dancing we argue that the notion of referencepoint plays a crucial role in licensing the matrixsubject of the construction in cr with the 
epistemic verbs seem and appear the matrixsubject functions as a 
referencepoint in relation to the pronominal copy if a copy exists in the embedded clause the aboutness topicality of the matrixsubject in cr is expected owing to its referencepoint property  the epistemic cr construction is acceptable without a pronominal copy if the matrixsubject functions as a referencepoint in relation to the complement clause the same type of analysis is applied to the cr construction with perceptual resemblance pr verbs  sound look feel and smell  leading 
to the conclusion that the strong dichotomy between epistemic and pr verbs is illusory  it is further demonstrated that expletive thereraising in cr is motivated by the same referencepoint phenomenon the difference between thereraising and other cr examples stems from the role of there as a setting subject our referencepointbased analysis

 introduction
the english subjecttosubject raising ssr construction 
illustrated in  has been an extensively researched topic across diverse 
theoretical frameworks since rosenbaum  
   mia seems to be leaving for the concert  ssr 
albeit similar copyraising cr shown in  contrasts with ssr in 
three distinctive ways first in the ssr example  the subject of the matrix clause is coindexed with the subject gap in the infinitival clause
 
this is different from the cr example  where the matrix subject is coindexed with the overtly realized pronoun in the complement clause second unlike ssr the cr predicate takes a tensed complement headed by like as if or as though the third noticeable difference is the choice of predicates 
while ssr is not permitted with perceptual resemblance pr 
verbs
 as in  cr is compatible with this verb class as shown in  
   mia seems like  as if  as though she is leaving for the concert  cr
    mia soundslooksfeels to be ready for the concert
   mia soundslooksfeels like she is ready for the concert 
compared to ssr significantly less attention has been paid to cr this 
is perhaps because cr was treated as a highly marked construction found only in english
 in reality cr is a widespread phenomenon observed in 
many different languages such as samoan chung  hebrew lappin  irish mccloskey  sells  haitian creole dprez  persian darzi  turkish moore  and swedish asudeh  toivonen 
cr was initially discussed from a generative linguistics perspective by rogers 
in a series of cls papers    and his phd dissertation  
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgereferencepoint and english copyraising  mack  provides an analysis from a discoursepragmatic perspective
  sentences are rated as acceptable scores    and unacceptable    notated by  
we understand that raters are more consistent with openended ratio scales than with the 
category rating scales like the one we adopted here johnson  stevens  but we chose it as a guideline for the purpose of simplicity 
  the range of acceptable sentences is wider than that of unacceptable ones participants were generally not in favor of cr and pr constructions for this reason we gave the  mark when the examples received conspicuously low ratingsand also by postal  more recently potsdam and runner  revisited 
this topic from a fresh perspective since then cr has drawn renewed attention from scholars as demonstrated by a handful of recent publications asudeh    asudeh  toivonen  fujii   kim  landau   mack  it is interesting to note that most of the aforementioned research was conducted from the formal linguistics perspective despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks the authors 
adopt
 as far as we are aware very little research examines this topic within 
cognitive linguistics
the main purpose of this paper is to develop an analysis of english cr 
constructions from a cognitive grammar viewpoint langacker  a 
b    and to present some broader implications of our analysis our specific objective is modest to show how cr can be naturally accommodated from a theoretical perspective very different from the previous 
proposals listed above the data we present in this paper come from three 
sources published papers corpus and web searches and our own intuition except for one korean example our data were surveyed among  native english speakers who rated the acceptability of each example using a standard likert scale

 proposal
we argue that the matrixsubject in  and  is licensed via the independently 
established informational construct known as referencepoint our view contrasts with the duallicensing approach horn  mack  rogers   sag  inter alia which assumes two distinct mechanisms one purely syntactic and the other interpretiveinformational more specifically we argue that the cr construction is an instance of referencepoint referencepoint is the human cognitive ability to conceptualize one entity through another ie referencepoint is a mental address to reach a 
target the aspects of the referencepoint relation are shown schematically 
in figure  in figure  c stands for the conceptualizer r for the referencepoint and d for the dominion  dominion constitutes the 
possible set of targets that a given referencepoint is related to the dashed 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turnerarrow is the mental path the conceptualizer follows to reach the target which 
is the entity accessed via the referencepoint
to illustrate a concrete case of referencepoint let us consider the possessive 
noun phrase sallys dog the possessive morphemes invokes a referencepoint relationship in the sense that x in the schematic possessive construction xs y functions as a mental address for y  by drawing a mental path from x to y  in this example sally is invoked as a referencepoint and dog is accessed via sally the notion of referencepoint has in fact been adopted in the analysis of various phenomena such as possessorpossessee langacker  taylor  multiple subject constructions kumashiro  langacker  park  and antecedentanaphora van hoek  among others
referencepoint plays an important role in discerning cr from ssr the 
matrixsubject of cr with epistemic verbs ecr is almost always topical whereas the same does not hold true for ssr see mack  we demonstrate that these differences are merely symptomatic of referencepoint variation in regard to prototypicality  a prototypical referencepoint relationship overtly identifies a referencepoint and its target within a relevant dominion while the matrixsubject of ecr exhibits a quintessential referencepoint property ssr does not as it lacks an overt target pronominal copy here we would like to emphasize that referencepoint is not identical to topicality  in his 
works langacker suggests that referencepoint is a sort of topic without providing further detailed descriptions on how they compare in our view  referencepoint is a necessary condition for topicality  if x is a topic then x is a referencepoint referencepoint is not a sufficient condition for topicality because it is possible that x  is a referencepoint without being a topic indeed 
in the literature that adopts the notion of referencepoint scholars such  
as kumashiro and langacker  and janda  utilize an implicit referencepoint which cannot be interpreted as a topic for example in the 
korean sentence  the relational nominal subject hand implicitly invokes 
fig  referencepoint illustrated redrawn after langacker  p 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgereferencepoint and english copyraising  a strong demarcation between epistemic verbs and pr verbs is untenable as shown in 
section  some epistemic verbs behave like pr verbs and vice versaa referencepoint the owner of the hand because without the owner the speaker 
cannot access hand see park  the implicitly invoked referencepoint 
functions as a mental address for hand in the lower clause without identifying a specific person although it ultimately corresponds to trump in the higher clause
 
   thulemphuka  soni  cakta
    trumpsubj  handsubj  besmall
    trump has small hands 
another interesting observation is the contrast between epistemic and pr 
verbs while pr verbs do not require a pronoun copy in the embedded clause as in b epistemic verbs generally do as shown in a
 
   a    dan seemedappeared like jean cooked salmon
  b  dan sounded like jean cooked salmon 
as will be discussed in detail later several scholars attempted to explain the difference between a and b by heavily relying on the notion of perceptual source psource here is a brief summary of the psourcebased analysis dans being the psource in b makes the sentence acceptable 
whereas the infelicity of a is attributed to the uninterpretability of dan  
as an evidential psource mack  p  rightly criticizes this type of approach by arguing that the evidential source for sound need not be 
perceptual at all evidence may also come from hearsay or inference in other 
words dan does not have to be an evidential psource to make b felicitous 
this is the view we too support that being said asudeh and toivonen  and landau  provide more sophisticated treatments of cr based on psource which is naturally not reflected in mack  due to the timing of the publications for this reason we revisit the psourcerelated predictions more carefully in this paper
instead of relying on the notion of psource we argue that the matrix
subject dan in a attempts to build a referencepoint relationship with its 
target whether it be a pronominal or the whole embedded clause dan then requires an explicit target to express an anaphoric link between itself and its corresponding pronoun or dan should be able to be interpreted within the context of jean cooked salmon in the former case the target is the pronoun 
while in the latter case the target is the whole embedded clause because no 
target pronoun is identified or cannot be established the resulting sentence is unacceptable b differs from a in that dan is a referencepoint in relation to the embedded clause the referencepoints target this is because the proposition made by the embedded clause can only be interpreted in 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turner  as will become clearer in later sections there in the examples like there is a riot in the park 
does not function as a referencepoint though it is indeed a setting subject
  the metonymic status of that book in this example is somewhat controversial if that book  
refers to a physical tome some linguists croft  ruiz de mendoza ibez  
would not consider it metonymic since they regard physical object as primary in 
the book domain as opposed to a secondary domain even so other linguists such as 
barcelona  would consider this at least peripherally metonymic for detailed discussion on the definition of metonymy please refer to benczes barcelona and ruiz de mendoza ibez dans dominion if dan is contextually related in this sense it functions very 
similarly to an external topic which mack  identifies as a subjective topic note that the same type of interpretation is not available in a
our approach exhibits great similarity to kims  p  perceptual 
characterization condition pcc he states that the matrixsubject of the cr construction serving as the topic is perceptually characterized by the rest of the utterance that said unlike kims pcc 
our analysis employs referencepoint which is a way to construe semantic 
content through a dynamic mental scanning process ubiquitously observed in human language
the relationship between referencepoint and topicality also brings into 
question the socalled expletive raising construction demonstrated by  which needs to be handled somewhat differently than the two aforementioned cr constructions
 
   there seemsappears like theres going to be a big mess in this department
 
in this example the two expletives are independently licensed as setting subjects at each level in langackers   terms nonetheless they are anaphorically linked note that the upper there functions as a referencepoint and the lower there as the target
 in this regard the underlying 
motivation behind thereraising is similar to other cr examples although our analysis shares general insights with mack  this is one major difference between her ideas and ours mack argues that examples like  are licensed via subjecttosubject copyraising sscr which is purely syntactically motivated this is because the matrixsubject there lacks aboutness topicality unlike subjects in other cr examples in our analysis 
 is almost identical to other cr examples and the differences stem from 
the independent source known as setting subject  as an abstract setting 
subject there merely hosts a relationship as opposed to being a participant 
in that relationship as a nonparticipant trajector there cannot be 
interpreted as a topical subject
our analysis predicts a metonymic interpretation
 of the matrixsubject 
in  since metonymy and referencepoint are inextricably linked phenomena

which is closely related as will be discussed in section  this type of example 
poses challenges to the psourcebased approaches because  is acceptable without a pronoun copy even though that book is not a psource we argue that the metonymic interpretation of that book is at the heart of this construction because that book functions as a referencepoint with respect to everyone 
should own a copy
 
   that book sounds like everyone should own a copy 
    heycock  p  landau  p  
we illustrate several variations of epistemic and pr verb examples 
accompanied by the challenges the examples face in a theoryneutral way  while we present the examples and the related issues we provide our approach in a more impressionistic way saving the technical analyses for a later section
 variations of  cr and the issues
in previous sections we introduced a typical example of cr with a brief 
description the focus of earlier research rogers    and its subsequent traditional movement analyses moore  ura  revolved around this type of example where the pronominal copy of the matrixsubject occurs in the subject position of the complement clause research conducted more recently asudeh  asudeh  toivonen  kim  landau   mack  reports that the cr phenomenon is much more complex than earlier researchers assumed this section illustrates an array of variations in cr in conjunction with related empirical and theoretical issues
 nonsubject cr
though not central to their studies a number of earlier researchers heycock  lappin  rogers  noted a variation of cr in which the pronominal copy is a nonsubject as illustrated in 
 
   mary appears as if her job is going well
   the broach looks to me like abbie gave it to myma
   bill sounds like martha hit him over the head with the record 
potsdam and runner  p  also recognize this variation and provide a reasonable analysis by claiming that the cr predicates in  are used thematically thereby differentiating them from the example shown in  according to potsdam and runner there is no movement in  the matrixsubject is basegenerated their evidence comes from idiom chunks 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turner  the notion of psource was introduced earlier in asudeh and toivonen   
their position is discussed in section in the cr construction as can be found in  although some speakers 
do not like either of the examples those surveyed unanimously agree  
that  is much more natural than  considering the common wisdom that the fraction of the idiom chunk appearing in the matrixsubject position in  is indicative of the verb not assigning a thematic role see postal  pullum  potsdam and runners  claim is justifiable the epistemic verb appears in  does not assign a thematic role because the embedded 
clause contains the subject pronominal copy  in their analysis the unacceptability of  is also straightforwardly explained appears assigns a thematic role to the idiom fraction the other foot because there is no subject pronominal copy  therefore the other foot receives two thematic roles leading to the clash
 
   the shoe appears like it is on the other foot
    the other foot appears like the shoe is on it 
that said potsdam and runners  analysis leads to an incorrect 
prediction landau  p  rightly points out that if potsdam and runner are right both your house and that noise in  and  must be thematic 
because there is no subject copy in the complement clause in either example nevertheless your house in  is not thematically related to sounds while 
that noise in  is in addition the pronominal copy it is obligatory in  while  is felicitous without it these differences cannot be explained in 
potsdam and runners  analysis
 
   your house sounds like nobody enjoys cleaning it
   that noise sounds like somebody is cleaning 
to overcome the difficulties landau  p  proposes the 
perceptualsource copy generalization pcg simply put 
pcg states that a copy is necessary in the complement clause if and 
only if the matrixsubject is not a psource landaus pcg successfully differentiates  from  in  your house is not a psource so the pronoun copy is required by contrast that noise is a psource in  which makes the sentence acceptable without a pronoun copy 
 here we need to 
define exactly what psource means in landau in all three examples in  the speaker makes visual contact with a stimulus however there are differences among the three while the stimulus is unspecified in a in b it is the matrixsubject john landau calls this type of example a psource reading 
c is different from the other two in that the visual stimulus is the grade sheet not john resulting in the matrixsubjects nonpsource reading

  b  heres john oh he looks like he has failed the exam
  c  heres the grade sheet oh john looks like he has failed the exam 
there is no denying that landaus  analysis shows improvement 
over potsdam and runner  nonetheless there are two important 
questions unanswered in landaus approach first why does the notion of psource play an important role in the cr landaus pcg can certainly make a distinction between  and  but why is a psource crucial for the absence or obligatoriness of a pronoun copy other than theoryinternal justifications
another challenge to landau  comes from the two examples 
borrowed from heycock  p  in these examples neither that book nor her apartment is a psource though both sentences are fully felicitous 
without a pronoun copy  landau reports that his informants find   reintroduced here as   slightly problematic and  somewhat worse contra his report the majority of our native speakers agrees that both are fully acceptable therefore we conclude that these are indeed counterexamples to his pcg
 
   that book sounds like everyone should own a copy 
   her apartment sounds like there must be a wonderful view  
landau is aware of this difficulty but he avoids detailed discussion of 
this issue by claiming that the examples are metonymic he  p  states that the range and accessibility of metonymic readings in various grammatical environments is a topic in its own right which we cannot delve into here we believe this is unfortunate because metonymy is crucial in the cr construction as demonstrated in later sections
 pr verbs
while rogers earlier research     does not make a clear distinction between epistemic and pr verbs asudeh    and asudeh and toivonen  do the key criterion of their distinction is whether a copy pronoun is required in a complement clause 
consider ab from asudeh and toivonen p  the pr verbs in a 
behave like epistemic verbs in that they can alternate with an expletive variant in b

according to asudeh and toivonen while the epistemic verbs cannot occur without a copy pronoun it is not obligatory for pr verbs
 
    tina seemsappears like  as if  as though chris has been baking sticky buns
   tina smellslookssoundsfeelstastes like  as if  as though chris has been baking sticky buns
 
we believe their observation is generally right however as several scholars 
kim  potsdam  runner  rogers  have pointed out it is not always straightforward to make a clear distinction between these two types of predicates in particular kim provides a rich set of data extracted from coca to illustrate ecr examples without pronoun copies for example as illustrated in  epistemic verbs may occur without a pronoun copy in a complement clause these examples show that asudeh and toivonens 
 dichotomy is too strong

asudeh and toivonen  p  are keenly aware of this problem and 
admit that certain speakers dialect d in their classification accept sentences like  they argue that the epistemic verbs in these types of examples are used as a sort of semantically bleached pr verb from the perspective of language change the claim that the verbs seem and appear gain the perceptual resemblance meanings albeit bleached needs to be carefully assessed in dealing with grammaticalization hopper and traugott  
p  state that there is no doubt that over time meanings tend to become 
weakened during the process of grammaticalization it is clear that epistemic verbs exhibit less semantic complexity than pr verbs we might expect pr verbs to become more like epistemic verbs but not the other way around however the potential solution to explain  proposed by asudeh and toivonen  assumes that the direction in the general grammaticalization cline is from epistemic to pr hopper and traugott  emphasize that this direction is not impossible but this type of pragmatic enrichment is often observed in the beginnings of grammaticalization asudeh and toivonens  claim thus remains unsatisfactory unless there is clear justification to say that this type of change is in an early stage and accompanied by relevant pragmatic enrichment
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgereferencepoint and english copyraisingwe support kim  by proposing that there is no critical difference 
between epistemic verbs and pr verbs concerning the optionality of a copy 
pronoun without respect to the type of a verb the major function of examples  is to mentally access the embedded clause through the matrixsubject indeed epistemic verbs are fully felicitous without a pronoun copy if the contextual information allows the interlocutor to access the embedded clause through the matrixsubject which is the case demonstrated in 
 expletives
one interesting characteristic of epistemic verbs is that they can copyraise expletives with some limitations for example some speakers we surveyed do not accept  while others do in a traditional movementbased analysis  can be evidence for copyraising the expletive there because there is not 
usually compatible with seems without a copy expletive in the complement clause as shown in  rogers  demonstrates that the copy of there must occur in the highest embedded subject position if not the sentence is not acceptable as in   illustrates that the expletive raising is also felicitous with the pr verb looks

    there seems like a lot of people are on the beach today 
    there seems like john expects there to be an election
   there looks as if there is a piece of evidence in this report to support the hypothesis
 
in relation to thereraising kaplanmyrth  p  reports that the number value of there between the two subjects must be identical as in  
otherwise the sentence is infelicitous as shown in 
 
   there looks as if there is a problem
   there look as if there are problems
    there looks as if there are problems 
our survey data conflict with this judgment most of our survey participants 
rated  noticeably higher than  which they rejected in other words 
the expletive there always takes a singular verb in the cr construction 
  we suspect that some pr verbs tend to be used as epistemic verbs examples like i 
where look is used in same environment as that of appear and seem is readily observed in 
naturally occurring conversations

these verbs might vary depending on speakers and their construals of a given situationour observation suggests that the two expletives are not fully identical 
although they are coreferential in the sense that the upper there cannot occur without the lower there as illustrated in 
the coreferential requirement between the two subjects does not apply 
when the matrixsubject is it as seen in  and  similar to   
 shows that there cannot occur in the matrixsubject position without its copy in the complement clause even when the subject of the complement 
clause is it

this issue will be addressed in section  in short we will show that the 
expletive examples fully conform to other cr examples we have discussed thus far
 cr ssr and topicality
now we would like to demonstrate how three related phenomena can be 
explained through referencepoint copyraising subjecttosubject raising and topicality 
 ecr and ssr
we note that the epistemic verbs behave differently from pr verbs in a certain context this is based on the observation that epistemic verbs readily alternate with the it  that construction as shown in  while pr verbs tend to resist 
this alternation as in  in this regard the cr construction resembles 
ssr
 
   a  mia seemsappears like she is leaving
  b  it seemsappears that mia is leaving
   a  mia smells like she was in the chicken coop
  b   it smells that mia was in the chicken coop 
let us consider a this cr example is very similar to the ssr example  
where mias leaving is located on the probability scale profiled by the 
epistemic verb in terms of langacker  p  the schematic process 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgereferencepoint and english copyraising  note that a correspondence relation is not identical to a referencepoint relationshipindicated by be leaving in  is mias active zone with respect to the scale 
therefore ssr exhibits a discrepancy between profile mia and active zone the process because what is located on the probability scale is not mia trajector but the process active zone the same discrepancy is observed in ecr
 
   mia seems to be leaving 
one noticeable difference between ssr and ecr is the obligatoriness of a pronoun copy when the matrixsubject corresponds to the subject of the embedded clause in ecr
 
   mia seems like she is leaving 
to illustrate the differences between  and  first note that in  the matrixsubject corresponds to the implicit subject of the embedded clause exhibiting that the two entities are identical nevertheless mia in  is not a referencepoint at least not a prototypical one because mia does not have an overtly identified target
 though the same correspondence relation 
applies in  mia in this example is a referencepoint in relation to its identified target she in other words in addition to the correspondence relation  
a referencepoint relationship is established in 
viewing the relation between a full nominal and its corresponding 
pronominal as a referencepointtarget relation is not surprising according to van hoek   the special property of a pronoun is its self
identification as a referencepoint in this case the referencepoint itself is 
the easiest element to access among all those in its dominion as a result the referencepoint full nominal and the target pronoun become coreferential van hoek argues that the likelihood of a nominal being invoked as a referencepoint depends on its prominence and the likelihood of an element being included in its dominion depends on the closeness of their conceptual connection in  mia is highly prominent by virtue of being a trajector 
of the process profiled by the clause that contains it as a highly prominent entity it is evoked as an antecedent for a pronoun here mia and the pronoun 
she are connected through the emergence of a coherent overall conception eg the probability scale of someone is leaving is tightly associated with mia 
under the given circumstance thus she falls within the dominion of mia
the nonsubject ecr examples in  are similarly explained as the 
matrixsubjects and their corresponding pronouns exhibit the coreferential relations as a referencepoint and target pair the pronoun does not need to appear in the subject position because the fundamental function of this cr 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turnerconstruction is to establish a coherent connection between the matrixsubject 
and the corresponding pronoun 
   a  the lawn appeared as if someone had mowed it   coca  mag kim  p 
  b   the forest appears as if a tornado had passed over it   coha  mag kim  p 
 
on rare occasions we observe that a pronoun copy can be omitted when the speech context provides relevant information and the target pronoun is not a subject in a normal situation for example someone had mowed in a is understood as someone had mowed the lawn similarly a tornado had passed over in b is understood as a tornado passed over the forest if these are 
indeed acceptable asudeh and toivonens  claim  that the epistemic cr construction requires a pronoun copy  needs to be reconsidered
 
   a  the lawn appeared as if someone had mowed
  b   the forest appears as if a tornado had passed over 
at this point it is worth discussing how kims pcc accounts for examples 
like ab kim argues that  cited from lappin  and asudeh and toivonen  respectively are unacceptable for reasons other than the lack of a pronoun copy the fact that mary is intelligent does not say any characteristic about bill neither does chriss baking sticky buns describe any characteristic about tina kim  p 
 
    bill appears as if mary is intelligent
    tina seems like chris has been baking sticky buns 
we fully agree with kims position as shown in ab epistemic verbs are permitted in cr without pronoun copies if the matrixsubject can create a mental connection with the embedded clause in other words ab are acceptable because the matrixsubjects can function as referencepoints in relation to their corresponding targets ie embedded clauses
the notion of referencepoint is helpful in explaining two earlier 
examples reintroduced as  idioms tend to maintain the trajector
landmark alignment however in the example the other foot appears like  
the shoe is on it the original alignment of the other foot is altered due to  
its appearance in the referencepoint position the originally nontopical 
landmark the other foot is thus in an aboutness relation to the predication 
in  by being a referencepoint trajector  becomes infelicitous because focal arguments of idiomatic expressions are not permitted in positions in which they express what the informationstructure literature refers to as switch topics  newly established topics see lambrecht  lambrecht  michaelis  for details

    the other foot appears like the shoe is on it 
it is also worth discussing macks  comparison of cr and ssr here 
she states that it is debatable whether ssr even constitutes a particularly 
appropriate comparison construction to cr p  her statement is 
based on the observations pp  in  in the cr examples  
the bare nominals are obligatorily interpreted as specific lappin  p  the same constraint does not apply to the ssr examples in  because the bare nominals in  can be interpreted either as kinds or existentially

we agree with mack that ecr subjects are licensed to serve as topics however our opinions differ concerning the sharp demarcation between 
ssr and ecr in her analysis ecr which contains a referential matrix
subject with a subject copy in the embedded clause is ambiguous between an ssrlike interpretation and an ecr interpretation the former is licensed by the sscr construct which is analogous to ssr but the latter 
is licensed by the topic licensing tl construction the major 
drawback of this demarcation is the difficulty of explaining examples like those in  which she herself admits mack  p  in her analysis 
the bare nominals in  must obey the type constraints imposed by tl 
yielding their specific kind reading nevertheless the bare nominals can also be licensed by sscr which is not a possible option in this case she 
notes that she does not presently have an explanation for why this should 
be the case p 
 
   a  cows seem like theyre extremely intelligent
  b  a man from hawaii sounds like hes the most popular candidate 
we argue that the different degrees of referencepoint in ssr and ecr yield different predictions the major function of referencepoint is to provide the interlocutor with a mental address to reach the target that is the prototypical 
referencepoint relationship establishes mental contact between two entities 
in the cr examples in  both cows and a man from hawaii exhibit this prototypical function of referencepoint because they contain their overtly 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turnerrealized targets in the embedded clauses this prototypicality strongly 
suggests that the bare nominals should be interpreted as topics by contrast the matrixsubject of ssr does not show the prototypical property of the referencepoint because it lacks its profiled target nonetheless the matrix
subject can still function as a referencepoint by appearing in the prominent 
position owing to this nonprototypicality the topicality of the matrixsubject is not strongly inferred the unacceptability of b and d is unproblematically explained in our account as well the matrixsubjects in these examples are prototypical referencepoints and they exhibit a high level of topicality leading to a specific reading of the subjects this reading however conflicts with the existential semantics of the complement yielding infelicity 
the notion of prototypicality is important in explaining expletive raising 
although raised expletives are referencepoints and they indeed correspond to their targets they are not like the prototypical referencepoint depicted earlier in figure  as abstract settings expletives themselves become their own dominions rather than invoking a set of possible targets this non
prototypicality blocks the topical interpretation of expletives
 cr and the external topic construction
the cr construction without a pronoun copy exhibits the properties of 
external topic constructions as illustrated in  this is because the embedded clauses in ac can only be fully interpreted in relation to their corresponding matrixsubjects which is also addressed by kims pcc kim 
 p  introduced earlier
 
   a  you smell like the tube needs some cleaning
  b  dan sounded like germany won the  world cup
  c  mr gunderson looked like the students didnt do their homework 
again 
sentences ac contrast with ac where the context provided by the matrixsubject does not alter the interpretation of the embedded clause because the matrixsubject is anaphorically linked to its corresponding subject pronoun
 
   a  you smell like you need to take a shower
  b  dan sounded like he won the  world cup
  c  mr gunderson looked like he didnt do the homework again 
we observe a similar pattern with nonsubject cr constructions as in  
in ac the embedded clause can be readily interpreted without the context provided by the matrixsubjects dominion

  b  dan sounded like germany won the  world cup for him
  c  mr gunderson looked like his students didnt do their homework 
again 
for this reason we propose that examples like  be analyzed as an external topic construction in which the matrixsubject is a referencepoint 
with respect to the embedded clause according to langacker  p  
being a matter of sequential mental access referencepoint relationships 
are intrinsically dynamic but have no intrinsic content following this 
definition the relational interpretation between the matrixsubject and the 
embedded clause is very flexible the perceptual resemblance verbs used in  are interchangeable with each other
now we would like to revisit landaus  examples introduced earlier 
which are renumbered as  for convenience according to landau  is not acceptable without the pronoun it while  is fully felicitous as 
it is p  his solution is that your house in  is not a psource whereas 
that noise in  is a psource recall that his pcg states that a copy is necessary if and only if the matrixsubject is not a psource since your 
house is not a psource in  the copy is required
 
   your house sounds like nobody enjoys cleaning it
   that noise sounds like somebody is cleaning 
however landaus pcg fails to explain some examples like ac although the matrixsubject your house is not a psource the sentences seem to be 
acceptable
 
   a  your house sounds like nobody enjoys cleaning at this very moment
  b  your house sounds like nobody is helping to clean right now 
  c  your house sounds like everybody helps with the cleaning 
this is because your house in ac functions as a referencepoint in 
relation to the embedded clauses where your house provides the context for 
apprehending and interpreting the propositions made by the complements 
this is no different from the pivotless external topic construction as in  
the proposition in  can only be interpreted in the dominion of the oval 
office if it figures into its content 
   the oval office i always thought i was going to have really cool phones 
and stuff president obamas remarks at a dnc fundraiser chicago 
 april  
then why is  not acceptable without it this is due to the difficulty in establishing a referencepoint relationship between your house and nobody 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turner  langackers osr examples include sentences like to like don is easyenjoys cleaning in  the speaker attempts to direct attention to your house 
for the specific purpose to make mental contact with nobody enjoys cleaning however without the pronoun nobody enjoys cleaning is interpreted as a general statement this genericity of nobody enjoys cleaning makes it hard for the interlocutor to establish mental contact with your house rendering  
unacceptable by contrast  does not pose the same problem because somebody is cleaning can be interpreted with someone specific in the speakers 
mind consequently it is feasible to establish a referencepoint relationship 
between that noise and somebody specific is cleaning where the latter is 
accessed via the former a closer examination also reveals that  can be rescued without it when a more specific context is provided as in 
 
   your house sounds like nobody upstairs enjoys cleaning
    context the speaker knows that the residents from the first and second floor of the addressees house are supposed to be cleaning their bedrooms that day  while the ground floor is noisy with the commotion of cleaning there is no noise emanating from above
 
these examples illustrate that the difference between  and  does not reside in the psource interpretation of the matrixsubject rather the difference is owed to the varying degrees of the conceptualizers referencepoint building capability 
 analysis
moving from the impressionistic to the technical we provide a full cg 
analysis of the cr construction in this section
 subjecttosubject raising
let us begin our analysis with an example of ssr langacker  argues that raising whether it be ssr sor or osr
 is a metonymic shift for 
example in the ssr sentence don is likely to leave the raising verb is likely to profiles a thing as its trajector whose location on the probability scale is mediated by a process in which it participates this schematic process is the trajectors active zone p  as a consequence the raised noun phrase don functions like a topic in that don calls to mind a process involving don the cg diagram for this example is provided in figure 
figure  a typical example of ssr demonstrates the discrepancy between 
active zone and profile first note that don d in the left box corresponds to the trajector in the inside box of the middle box as notated by the 
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgereferencepoint and english copyraising  typical prepositions are represented as a relationship between a thing and an entity  
perhaps this more schematic type of structure for like and as ifthough is what led 
some scholars bender  flickinger  to categorize them as something other than prepositionsdashed line which also corresponds to the trajector in the right box also 
note that the hatched rectangle in the middle box is elaborated by the right box leave and the trajector in the middle box is elaborated by the left box don
now  let us focus on the middle box to show the discrepancy  here what is 
profiled note the thick line in the hatched box is the trajector don but the box not the trajector interacts with the probability scale then as langacker 
argues ssr exhibits a case of profileactivezone discrepancy 
 the case of ecr
the epistemic cr examples with a pronoun copy exhibit a great similarity to 
those of ssr figure  shows the cg diagram for the sentence deandre seems like he is leaving the only noticeable difference between figure  and figure  is observed in the right box as a schematic preposition
 like 
invokes a relationship between two entities and places the landmark on the probability scale which corresponds to that profiled by seems the implicitly invoked trajector of like corresponds to the trajector of the clause he is leaving where he is a target of the referencepoint subject deandre similar to ssr 
this cr example illustrates a profileactivezone discrepancy in that the trajectors deandre probability scale seems is mediated by the process he is 
leaving in which deandre also participates as a trajector the process he is 
leaving is an active zone in this case
next let us consider the example darin seems like jared hit him the 
diagram of which is provided in figure  figure  is identical to figure  except that the referencepoint relationship is established between darin  
and the landmark of the relationship profiled by hit consequently the 
fig  don is likely to leave redrawn after langacker  p

hitrelationship
we have shown that the examples of ecr with pronominal copies are 
similar to ssr particularly in the sense that both of them show a case of 
profileactivezone discrepancy  the unique property of cr is an additional referencepoint relationship established between the matrixsubject and a thing whether it be a trajector or a landmark profiled in the likeclause
 the case of the pr verbs
figure  shows the cg diagram for the sentence derrick sounds like he is 
playing guitar the right box is identical to that of figure  and figure  however the middle box that characterizes sounds is different from seems 
sounds does not invoke a probability scale and this construction does not 
exhibit a profileactivezone discrepancy 
in figure  the trajector of sounds derrick corresponds to the trajector 
he of is playing and both of them are anaphorically linked where derrick is 
a referencepoint in relation to he just like figure  the implicitly invoked trajector of like corresponds to he finally the landmark of sounds is elaborated by the likeclause
fig  the cg diagram for darin seems like jared hit him
fig  the cg diagram for deandre seems like he is leaving

due to the correspondence depicted in figure  what sounds does is to mediate erica and 
jean cooked salmon so that the conceptualizer interprets the depicted event as one which is inferred indirectly we are also interested in pr verbs without a pronominal copy such as 
erica sounds like jean cooked salmon the cg diagram for this sentence is 
provided as figure  the crucial difference between figure  and figure  is the matrixsubjects referencepoint role while derrick is a referencepoint in respect to a thing in figure  erica is a referencepoint in relation to x sounds like jean cooked salmon
 where x corresponds to erica this is 
because the implicitly invoked trajector of like does not correspond to jean or salmon clauseinternally  instead it corresponds to the trajector  
of sounds clauseexternally  as a result the preposition like establishes a 
relationship between the clause jean cooked salmon and its trajector erica this correspondence enables the conceptualizer to interpret jean cooked salmon within the dominion of erica via the given auditory stimulus yielding 
a rough paraphrase like considering how erica talks i guess jean cooked salmon the clause jean cooked salmon is interpreted within the dominion of erica precisely the function of the external topic construction
now  let us revisit heycocks example reintroduced as  which landau 
treated as an anomaly or something that does not fall within the purview of his research
 
   that book sounds like everyone should own a copy  
in our analysis the metonymic nature of that book is naturally explained just like figure  that book in  is a referencepoint in relation to x sounds 
like everyone should own a copy with a rough paraphrase like as for that book 
people are talking about i believe everyone should own a copy of it

there is an ample amount of research please refer to geeraerts and peirsman  paradis  and ruiz de mendoza ibez   among othersthe referencepoint phenomenon can facilitate a referential shift when the 
phenomenon is metonymic in nature in  that book illustrates a referential 
shift from content to physical tome though being a referencepoint does not guarantee a referential shift
 the metonymic reading of  is quite 
expected in our analysis due to the inherent connection between metonymy and referencepoint in fact metonymy is basically a referencepoint phenomenon langacker  p 
 expletives and setting subjects
before we present our analyses of the expletives we would like to illustrate the characterization of there langacker a pp  langacker 
suggests that there and the be verb be treated as an integrated unit based 
on example  in this example people is not the logical subject of say  
but only of dance yet the main clause verb is plural p  nonetheless the choice of the number value is plural in this case as langacker briefly notes it seems that there undergoes a semantic extension to be construed as a special type of plural this is because multiple participants are involved in the situation described in 
 
   there are said to be people dancing in the streets 
the schematic cg diagram for there is shown in figure  here there designates an abstract setting construed as hosting some relationship represented by the 
fig  the cg diagram for erica sounds like jean cooked salmon

relationship profiled by be as shown in the bottom right box in the composite structure illustrated in the top box we observe the shift in focus resulting in the 
trajector status conferred on the setting
based on figure  figure  illustrates the cg diagram for the sentence 
there seems like there is a book in the right box of figure  there acquires an 
abstract setting subject status and it corresponds to the implicit trajector of 
like the left box illustrates seems which is almost identical to that of other 
previous examples as shown in the right box there shifts to the setting subject which in turn corresponds to the trajector of the matrixsubject as a setting subject the trajector of the matrix clause does not have to be elaborated by another thing the setting subject status fills the need for a subject this is why the copy of there is permitted only in the subject position this is where maximally generalized settings appear
our analysis correctly predicts the unacceptability of  in  
while there is a setting subject in the street is a location which is part of a 
setting langacker a p  therefore the correspondence relation

target are anaphorically linked in the cr construction  is unnatural due to the depth of the correspondence the upper there corresponds to the there  
in the deepest clause
 
    there seems like people are dancing in the street
    there seemed like john said there were people dancing in the street
 
another expletive it is illustrated in figure  the expletive it also 
functions as a maximally generalized setting subject in this case while there denotes a thinglike property  figure  is almost identical to figure  the only difference is the lack of the correspondence relationship between the trajector of seems and the trajector of the likeclause instead of corresponding the two trajectors the strategy adopted here is to confer the trajector status to the entire setting which is very close to sentences like it is raining and its hard 
to finish this paper etc for this reason sentences like it seems like there is a 
book are no different from it seems like john is happy etc
then why is a sentence like there seems like it is raining unacceptable 
this is because as a thinglike setting subject there notated by a circle needs a target which is the property of the cr construction however as a maximally abstract setting subject without a referential identity it fails to be theres target the rescue mechanism is to replace there with it yielding it seems like it is raining where two instances of it acquire their setting subject status independently without requiring any referential identity

test material in you that way   coca  fic
   is he all right the girl said appears like it raymond said   coca  fic
   and he was in there he was talking on the phone sounded like he was talking to susan  coca  spok
 
the expletive it cannot be used as a referencepoint to any thing target nor can it build an anaphoric link with its pronominal form what it does is to provide a setting which the participants occupy  consequently the setting is often contextually understood without its explicit grammatical realization
 conclusion and summary
we developed a cg analysis of the cr construction and demonstrated that 
referencepoint plays a crucial role in licensing the matrixsubject of cr whether the cr verbs are epistemic or perceptual resemblance in this sense 
fig  the cg diagram for it seems like there is a book
core terms of use available at httpswwwcambridgeorgcoreterms  httpsdoiorglangcogdownloaded from httpswwwcambridgeorgcore  hekman library  calvin college  on  oct  at   subject to the cambridgepark and turnerour approach can be considered a singlelicensing mechanism distinct from 
the majority view of a duallicensing mechanism
we demonstrated that the ecr construction with pronominal copies 
exhibits great similarities to ssr in that both of them involve a typical 
profileactivezone discrepancy  the differences between the two cases are 
symptomatic of the different degrees of referencepoint manifestation since cr shows a prototypical referencepoint relationship the matrix verb of cr requires an aboutness topical reading the same does not hold true for ssr because the matrixsubject of ssr is a not prototypical referencepoint we extended our analysis to cr constructions containing pr verbs demonstrating that they are not crucially different from those with epistemic verbs concerning the optionality of pronominal copies we also demonstrated that expletive raising need not be treated separately as a purely syntactic mechanism because the lack of topicality of the matrixsubject in this case is a natural consequence of expletives setting subject nature
throughout this paper we illustrated that our analysis explains a wider 
range of data without positing additional assumptions or mechanisms 
moreover we argued that examples treated as marginal cases by previous 
researchers such as possible metonymic interpretations of these constructions are at the heart of the cr construction and are naturally explained in our analysis

cognitive grammar and english nominaliza
tion eventresult nominals and gerundives
httpsdoiorgcog
received august   revised february   accepted march  
abstract this article develops an analysis of eventresult nominals and gerund
ives from a cognitive grammar perspective by reviewing the previous research
we first point out that these phenomena are much more flexible than the extant
research claims moreover widely accepted generalizations concerning the phe
nomena are at best only partially true we demonstrate that the said flexibility
is ascribed to two different types of construals  masslike construal accom
panied by reification and  zoneactivation or metonymic shift event nominals
arise without respect to the types of the nominal affixes when the relationship
profiled by a verb takes an internal perspective result nominals arise through
zone activation or metonymic shift in addition to the reification of the verbal
base several grounding strategies apply to both event and result nominals
thereby yielding different realizations of instances such as indefinite and
possessive we show that our analysis can be systematically extended to ger
undives which permit limited grounding methods we also demonstrate that
vton converted event nominals are accounted for unproblematically in our
analysis because the rise of event nominals does not rely on the nominalizing
affixes

grimshaw  
over the course of time two main approaches to this issue have emerged the
structural model and the eventbased model in the structural model alexiadou
 borer   embick  marantz  the presence of argument
structure is attributed to the existence of a vp within the nominal structure this
approach stipulates that exponents such as  ing ation  and  ment express
nominal categories but they are different with respect to the height of affixation
the higher the affix is in the structure the more verbal properties the derived
noun exhibits the  ingtargets a high position resulting in event nominals
while the vton conversion occurs at the root level as a result conversion does
not exhibit argument structure because it does not contain verbal projections
other affixes such as  ation and  ment can be attached either to the root or at a
higher position
by contrast the eventbased theory grimshaw   assumes that the
presence of argument structure in a nominal is the consequence of the existence
of an event structure in its base verb the grammar then stipulates that some
affixes preserve the verbal property of having argument structure while others
do not despite many differences concerning matters of implementation both
models assume that there is a tight connection between argument structure and
affixes that is nominalizing affixes are somehow responsible for the derivation
of event nominals
we challenge this view by arguing that the connection between the two is
more loose than the previous models assumed affixes do not even have to be
present in the derivation of event nominals the theoretical framework we adopt
is cognitive grammar cg developed by langacker b   
what we propose is that these seemingly sharp delineations concerning argu
ment structure and affixes are merely symptomatic of the fundamental function
of deverbal nominalization construing the verbal relationship from the inter
nal perspective in the sense of cg we argue that deverbal nominalization
comes to light via two different types of construals  masslike construal
accompanied by reification and  zoneactivation or metonymic shift when
the base event structure a relationship takes an internal perspective the
relationship is construed as masslike and homogeneous the relationship is
construed as an unbounded event as a direct result of the internal perspective
at the same time this perspective makes it possible to preserve the relationship
between two entities resulting in nominals with baseverbal arguments chongwon park and bridget park
authenticated  cparkdumnedu authors copy

if this is the case and we argue that it is the result nominal devoid of
argument structure is not a semantic side effect occurring when event nom
inals masslike properties are altered to those of count nouns as suggested by
harley   rather result nominals lacking argument structure are just a
common product of our conceptual and linguistic system
in some sense our view is a reflection of alexiadou  and harley
 both of whom recognize the importance of the masscount distinction
in dealing with event nominals the gist of their claims is that event nominals
are similar to mass nouns while result nominals are like count nouns that said
we believe their approaches are somewhat inconclusive and speculative without
providing the motivation behind the creation of a mass noun from a verbal base
more importantly contra the authors claims we demonstrate that event nom
inals can be used as count nouns as illustrated in where they are modified
by temporal adjectives and presented with argument structure

these examples strongly suggest that the claim that the function of deverbal
nominalization is to create a mass noun from its base verb is only a partial story
the intermediate stage of eventnominal creation indeed exhibits mass noun
like properties due to the imposed internal perspective yet this stage does not
produce full nominals lacking a grounding element such as the this o r that
the deverbal nominalization is completed upon the application of the grounding
mechanism we further demonstrate that the  ingnominals are parallel to
deverbal event nominals in that they too need to be grounded to be full
nominals whether it be overtly or covertly

 langacker  provides foundational cg work on gerundives and
heyvaert   further develops langacker s ideas however as is often
the case for most research their work still can be improved upon to capture a
wider range of data for example just as grimshaw  does langacker
  suggests that  ingnominals are mass nouns and cannot be pluralized
we find this to be too strong a statement more importantly neither langacker

with event nominals leaving event nominals a lesserexamined topic within cg

my kill of the time  as in c  ingnominals are transparent to their verbal base

however the other three generalizations pose significant challenges to the two
models addressed above
 conversion with event structure
let us begin our discussion with the second generalization described in b
neither model we discussed earlier the structural model and the eventbased
model allows vton conversions a s event nominals in the eventbased
model the preservation of the base event structure is mediated by affixes
these nominals cannot have an event structure then simply because they are
affixless the handling of the case of conversion becomes more complicated in
the overall structural model in her exoskeletal model one type of structural
model borer    argues that conversions arise by merging the
root verb with a functional head to directly transform it into a nominal which
is a derivation process that does not p roduce argumentbearing nominals
another structural model distributed morphology alexiadou  embick

there is no denying that the conversions in bold in examples a g are
interpreted eventively because they display full argument structure andor can
be modified by temporal adjectives like constant orfrequent  based on smith s
 report about conversions grimshaw  argues that germanicorigin
vton conversions never preserve the original verbs event and argument struc
tures according to her because germanic verbs nominalize only through zero
affixation germanicorigin conversions cannot be complex event nominals
however though the base verbs of all conversions in a g are indeed of
germanic origin the conversions are all event nominals with full argument
structure this phenomenon is not limited to the few nominals describedcognitive grammar and english nominalization 
authenticated  cparkdumnedu authors copy
download date    amabove rather it is a widespread phenomenon and for this reason the event
based model faces a serious challenge
these examples pose an issue for the structural model as well conversions
with argument structure are not permitted in borer s exoskeletal model because
the height of the conversion in the tree structure is too low to contain event
structures albeit similar to the exoskeletal model it seems that distributed
morphology dm can handle this issue by positing two zero affixes one in relation
to a result interpretation of the conversion and the other for an eventive inter
pretation however many scholars warn against the use of a zero form without
rigid justification for example pullum    suggests that null consti
tuents should not be utilized unless they meet the criteria laid out in 
 three conditions for positing phonologically null constituents
a the empty category is syntactically bound to another constituent in an
unbounded dependency construction ie extraction trace
b the empty category is anaphorically linked to another constituent ie
null anaphor or controlled pro
c the empty category is associated with independently justifiable semantic
content eg a constructionspecific semantic rule such as  npthe rich n
the potential dm solution does not meet any of the three criteria for its use of
a zero affix yielding a lessappealing analysis in our evaluation in fact though
working in a similar framework to dm borer  provides a strong set of
arguments against zero affixes we will not delve into the details here but what
she argues in evaluating dm is that there are no zero realizations categorically
equivalent to  ation  ie conversion is not a result of a zero derivation the
theoretical framework we adopt in this article is of course drastically different
from borer s nonetheless we see a great similarity between cg and borer s
model in this particular claim we don t need categoryaltering zero affixes for
the process of nominalizatin in english given the conceptual content of a
certain entity its category would have to be contextually determined through
interlocutors construals this is the position that both borer and cg agree
upon
newmeyer  also discusses that zeroderived nominals can have argument structure he
attributes this behavior of vton converted nominals to the historical development of the
vocabulary of english
of course from a cg perspective the question emerges whether a zero element should be
posited at all for example even pullum s justifiable case of positing the empty category c
can be avoided by assuming a simple conversion pattern chongwon park and bridget park

download date    am on the ambiguity of the affixes
alexiadou and grimshaw s  generalization d poses some challenges as
well first the structural model assumes that the affixes  ation and  ment are
underspecified as a result it can be stipulated that these affixes occur in both
root and outer cycles setting aside some potential theoretical problems with this
type of analysis see embick  this twocycle approach does not address the
reasons why this widespread ambiguity exists against the underspecification
approach grimshaw  proposes that the apparent ambiguity is due to the
twostep nominalization an event nominal is created by the affixation of  a
tion orment step  partial nominalization followed by a null affixation step
full nominalization that wipes out the event structure properties of the base
these affixes are neither ambiguous nor underspecified the affixes are always
complex event nominalizers
we are not sure if grimshaw s twostep nominalization approach is cru
cially different from the structural model s twocycle approach additionally
positing another layer of zero affixation on top of the complex event nominal
structure is hard to justify because the zero affix is neither semantically
contentful nor syntactically bound moreover we are not sure how the elim
ination of the internal event structure operates in step  even if we assume
that grimshaw s approach is justifiable we cannot explain why the zero
affix cannot be attached to  ing nominals to derive a result nominal
alexiadou and grimshaw are aware of th is weakness and they acknowledge
that neither the eventbased nor the structural model answers the question of
why only these affixes allow twostep no minalizations as it turns out these
affixes are not that special other affixes including  ingalso allow twostep 
nominalizations
as will get clearer in section  our position concerning the ambiguity of
nominalizing affixes is that the two interpretations of these affixes are not
associated with their structural properties ie affixation at different cycles or
twostep nominalization rather they are due to the metonymic shift in nomi
nalization or the speaker s zone activation ability it should be clear that we are
not assuming that metonymy comes about by attaching an affix to its base on
the syntagmatic axis suffixations are not the result of metonymic operations
what we are assuming is as panther  and brdar and brdarszabo 
argue metonymy is a paradigmatic operation

alexiadou and grimshaw s  generalization c is roughly accurate in
that the  ingaffix preserves the event structure in a different piece of work

 alexiadou  also proposes that the problem of pluralization of
argumentbearing nominals has to do with unboundedness plurality unbound
edness and mass nouns are all related she alexiadou   proposes this
generalization in  stating that pluralization can apply to bounded nominals
to yield unbounded nominals which is the function of pluralization since
nominals derived from the verbs of unbounded events are like mass nouns
pluralization cannot apply
 a count nouns are similar to bounded events
b mass nouns are similar to unbounded events
though this is indeed true alexiadou s generalization is far from being novel
langacker s cg a   provides indepth discussion on significant
parallels between nouns and verbs as well as between nominals and finite
clauses the reason the examples of our own creation a b are not accep
table is relatively straightforwardly explained in cg although langacker does
not discuss these types of examples directly the base verbs in  are all
imperfective verbs in cg terms which is the same concept as alexiadou s
unbounded events while imperfective verbs exhibit great conceptual similari
ties to mass nouns both of them are unbounded perfective verbs show
conceptual affinity to count nouns both of them are bounded the nomina
lized verbs in  cannot be pluralized or be used as indefinite singulars both of
which are the properties of bounded nouns this is so because the bases of
these nouns are imperfective verbs that are more similar to mass nouns as
opposed to count nouns this is in fact very similar to alexiadou s observation

davidse  heyvaert    independent of langacker and cg
a similar position is also observed in schachter  these researchers do not
deal with event nominals directly but the main idea behind their analyses is
identical to alexiadou s generalization
it is worth noting that the grammatical behavior of  ingnominals such as
pluralization is a reflection of their conceptual properties generally imperfective
verbs like doubt profile a stable situation with no intrinsic endpoint in certain
situations however these verbs can be construed as events that constitute a
change indeed some imperfective verbbased  ingnominals behave like count
nouns as in  though these situations are rare and highly contextualizedfor
example doubting  in the context of christian belief is often viewed as a stage of
spiritual growth mcgrath  that we believe has a soontocome terminal
stage in this context doubting exhibits a conceptual similarity to perfective verbs

another disappointing aspect of alexiadou s proposal is that her analysis is not
fully developed although her later research alexiadou et al  provides a
more detailed crosslinguistic analysis based on number and aspect projections
it still lacks an explanation of how and why nouns and verbs exhibit parallel
patterns concerning boundedness

interlocutors cannot make a distinction between the talkedabout member and
the rest of the members in the same category the most obvious grounding
method is to utilize an overt grounding element which is the case in d and
e in d  ingimposes the is on the process profiled by the base verb read

 clausal nominalizations
in this section we extend our analysis of event nominals to clausal nominaliza
tion we demonstrate that the function of  ingin clausal nominalizations is
identical to that of ingofgerunds the crucial difference between ingofger
unds and clausal nominalizations comes from the grounding methods the two

maximal extension

provide valuable insights on the gerundive phenomena though due to space
constraints we cannot discuss them in depth we note that two research
proposals alexiadou et al  and heyvaert   are particularly
germane to our proposal although these authors do not cite each other s work
both proposals treat gerundives as similar to mass nouns which is also our
view in their dmbased approach alexiadou et al propose a hierarchy of
functional projections that include nominal num class and verbal asp vp
alexiadou et al s approach to gerundives is thus nominaloververbal which is
the most widely accepted view by contrast working from a functional perspec
tive heyvaert  adopts halliday s  notion of rankshift in this view
gerundives involve the shift of a clausal configuration of functions from clausal
to nominal rank while maintaining their internal clauselike structure
furthermore based on schachter  heyvaert proposes a nominal analysis
of gerundives by claiming that gerundive nominalizations fit in with the nominal
paradigm internally her evidence comes from the subcategories of gerundives
the system of gerundive nominalizations draws on two basic nominalconstruc
tional options viz those of specific definite or indefinite and nonspecific viz
generic reference heyvaert   although we believe heyvaert s choice
of the words a nominal analysis of gerundives is somewhat of an overstate
mentwe are generally in support of heyvaert in that we also believe specifi
city plays an important role in understanding different types of clausal
gerundives
that being said we believe heyvaert s analysis needs more clarification in
dealing with examples like heyvaert   argues that the presence
of the oblique nongeneric subject youturns the gerundive nominalization into
the conception of a specific instance rather than a type and the downranked unit

some extent gerundives are different from prototypical mass nouns also we are not sure how
the object of the base verb is treated in her nominal gerundive approach she argues that the
combination of the object with the verb does not create an instance this is true and we agree
with her but the object is still the object of the verb elaborating the landmark of the process
profiled by the verb in terms of cg if so there exists a verbal property at least at this stage

this is true when the gerundives appear in the subject position however when
they appear in the complement position with a nonfactive matrix verb they
allow different interpretations let us consider examples   from portner
 in these examples as portner demonstrates only the a examples with
the poss gerundive have a familiarity presupposition in the b examples it is
not necessary that the familiar situation of john coming to visit mary be actual
put differently when the accgerund occurs with a nonfactive matrix verb in
the complement position it can be interpreted as nondefinite while poss 
gerunds are always definite without respect to factivity or their syntactic
position

in relation to the presupposition issue the difference in case marking between
poss gerunds and accgerunds should not be treated lightly this is because this
formal difference is not accidental it is a close reflection of the functional
differences these issues need to be incorporated to provide a fullfledged
picture of gerundives
 a cgbased analysis of clausal nominalizations
our proposal concerning clausal nominalizations is summarized in the follow
ing the function of  ingis identical to that of ingofgerundives the  ingused in
clausal nominalization imposes is on the profiled process as well the difference
is that the is is imposed at a later stage in the case of clausal nominalizations
after the landmark of the verb is elaborated by its object this is so far basically
the same as langacker s  treatment of gerundives the resulting relation
ship of the is imposition can turn into a noun by reification this is a noun in
the sense that it specifies a type not an instance as a type specification it
needs to be grounded to be a full nomimal the important part of our proposal
resides in the grounding methods adopted in clausal nominalizations when an
event denoted is factive the reified process is grounded indirectly by the
possessive when an event is nonfactive the speaker has another option ie
grounding the reified entity locationally the gerundive portion in b john
smoking stogies  may thus be interpreted as in john s domain of experience
there exists a reified event in which john participates as a trajector where the
reified event is nondefinite note that the nondefinite construal is available

rumor about bill s getting fired  we slightly modified her original examples to include the

construal of these gerundives is still the definite interpretation this means that
b can be identical to a in their definitenessrelated predictions under a
nonfactive context in this case the only difference between the two becomes
the case pattern of the subjectoid which will be explained later in this section
to illustrate what exactly we mean by locational grounding we first need to
discuss the location and the existence schemas figure a illustrates the location
schema that roughly translates to an entity is located in a delimited region 
figure b which is the existence schema is interpreted as an entity is located
in the domain of existence  not surprisingly these two schemas exhibit great
similarities

perhaps the best example that can be analyzed by the locative schema is

indicated by the bold horizontal line on the right side of t at the lower level of
organization not shown here magoga is grounded independently of
watashiniwa ias the trajector of the clausally grounded existence relation

the important observation is the independence of the target  mago  in ground
ing different from the possessive construction a case of the regular reference
point construction the locativeschemainduced structure does not utilize the

with this background we return to the accgerundive example b which

john  as a consequence the reified event does not have to be definite
nonetheless john corresponds to the trajector of the relationship profiled by
the verb yielding the subjectoid interpretation of john  although it is accusative
casemarked the order of operations is critical here the is was imposed only
after the elaboration of the landmark  stogies  of the relationship profiled by
smoke  owing to the later stage of the is imposition this construction naturally
exhibits more verbal properties than ingofgerundives in figure  the refer
ence point john  is a landmark in relation to the trajector smoking stogies  this is
so because as shown in the rough rephrase above john does not directly
participate in the existence relationship what exists is the reified relationship

to a the reified event smoking stogies is rounded indirectly by john as
shown by the circled g which becomes possible owing to john sb e c o m i n ga
reference point trajector in relation to smoking stogies  this is therefore
identical to the ingofdepicted in figure  though the compositional path
ways of the two figures are different in figure  smoke and stogies
are combined before the imposition of is to yield the structure which is
different from figure  regardless john ss m o k i n gs t o g i e s functions like an
inherently definite nominal owing to the definite grounding of the reified

figure  possessive grounding chongwon park and bridget park
authenticated  cparkdumnedu authors copy
download date    amwhile the subjectoid is realized with the possessive marking by being a trajector
of a reference point relationship in figure  it is realized with the accusative
case in figure  this is because the subjectoid in accgerundives is a landmark
which receives the default case in english as macfadden  and schtze
 demonstrate the accusative case plays this role
in both cases the internal structures are wellpreserved as shown by the
depiction that the reference point corresponds to the trajector of the relationship
profiled by the base verb the preserved internal structure of clausal gerundives
leads to the interpretation of a set of reified events before grounding or a
specific reified event after grounding owing to this preserved eventivity
clausal gerundives are modified by adverbs this is not a surprising conse
quence particularly considering the traditional treatment of adverbs for exam
ple in neodavidsonian semantics davidson  parsons  adverbs are
interpreted by predicating them not of an individual or a property but rather of
an event as a result a sentence that includes an adverb is interpreted as an
event that has an adverbial property this view tells us that adverbial modifica
tions are more likely semanticsbased as opposed to grammatical category
based our treatment of clausal gerundives as reified events naturally explains
adverbial modification of gerundives in that what the adverb modifies is an
event morzycki   illustrates the parallelism between adverbs and
adjectives in the davidsonian semantic approach if we interpret his position
in cg terms adverbs modify relationships while adjectives modify things since
reified gerundives are not typical things with their internal structure fully pre
served with their objects fully realized for instance adjectival modification is
often not preferred or not permitted at all
concerning accgerundives taylor    cautiously suggests
that the accusativemarked subjectoid might be due to the ungrounded status
of the nominalized clause as an ungrounded clause the gerundive lacks an
intrinsic aspect of subjectverb agreement and the subjectoid is realized as a
nonnominative form the default case in our terms although his suggestion is
reasonable there are a couple of problems in taylor st r e a t m e n to f accger
undives first the nominalized clause does not need a clausal grounding that
involves a tense marking on the finite verb because it is a full nominal
so taylor s clausal groundingbased suggestion is somewhat irrelevant to
this case
second as a nominal type specification nominalized clauses need to be
nominally grounded instead of clausally in the earlier example a for
instance the nominalized clause smoking stogies needs to be nominally
grounded by john s similarly smoking stogies needs to be nominally grounded

 subjectless gerundives
before moving on we would like to discuss the third type of clausal nominaliza
tions subjectless gerunds as described earlier in  heyvaert  provides
an informative categorization of these summarized in 
 heyvaert s categorization of subjectless gerundives
a specific
i retrievable subject
ex had decided to boycott me for the mere fact of having written
a book on franco 
heyvaert  
ii retrievable and reinsertable subject
exof course i regret getting pregnant 
heyvaert  
b nonspecific generic
i controlled subject clausal type specification is instantiated
exhaving an ugly wife makes a man mean 
heyvaert   postal  
ii true subjectless clausal type specification
exeating vegetables is healthful 
heyvaert  
according to heyvaert while ai and aii denote a specific and single
instance of a process type bii denotes a clausal type specification in the
latter case no single event reading is possible bi allows either a generic or a
specific readingwe agree with heyvaert in that ai and aii have specific
interpretations particularly when the subject can be retrievable and reinserta
ble whether the process is anaphoric or exophoric this is naturally accounted
for in our analysis based on grounding in ai and aii the gerundives are
indirectly grounded by the retrievable and reinsertable subject thereby leading
to proper nounlike definite descriptions however we believe bi and bii
need more clarification
a specific reading is possible when the subject is retrievable chongwon park and bridget park
authenticated  cparkdumnedu authors copy
download date    amlet us consider bii first in which eating vegetables is a clausal type
specification in terms of heyvaert if this is the case how does this function as a
full nominal abney    provides several syntactic tests to prove that
true subjectless gerunds behave like full canonical nominals we provide the
same set of tests with the madeup examples in  
 i learned about eating vegetables  object of a preposition
 iseating vegetables healthy subjectauxiliary inversion
 i believe that eating vegetables should be more encouraged  subject of
embedded sentence
 perhaps eating vegetables has more health benefits we are unaware of 
subject following initial adverb
 eating vegetables i can t abide  topic position
 itseating vegetables that i can t abide  cleft position
bi faces a similar problem heyvaert states that bi can be interpreted
specifically or generically this is because the subject of the gerund having an
ugly wife can be recovered as a specific person or it can just denote a type
rather than an instance in other words heyvaert generally equates genericity
with a type and specificity with an instance however genericityspecificity
and typeinstance are separate notio ns consider the examples in  from
krifka et al  the nominals the potato and potatoes in a and b
refer to a kind as opposed to some individual potatoes or a specific group of

expresses a generalization about pota toes in all three cases the subject
nominals express genericity even though they are grounded instances
genericity does not require a type speci fication instances can express gener
icity too the difference between the in stances in  and others is actuality
as langacker   describes instead of being actual an instance of a
type can be conjured up for a special purpose one of them being a general
statement  the instances in  are all conjuredup entities to express gen
ericity which makes them distinct from typical instances nevertheless they
are clearly different from type specifications concerning their grounding and
meaning they are indeed instancescognitive grammar and english nominalization

our solution for true subjectless gerunds is to adopt the notion of maximal
extension langacker defines maximal extension as follows
maximal extension reflects a number of conceptual phenomena   through grouping
and reification conceived instances are pulled together and viewed as a unitary entity
the maximal extension further represents a conceptual blend combining properties that
cannot actually coexist in particular those of both count and massnoun referents on
the one hand it is conceptualized as a mass of indefinite extension   at the same time
we conceptualize it as a bounded entity one that is somehow limited in extent langacker
 
the properties of subjectless gerundives we have discussed thus far fit this
description of maximal extension as a maximal extension they are virtual
speakers are not referring to any actual instances rather what they are refer
ring to are fictive instances a maximal extension is clearly an instance
grounded somewhat differently from other types of grounding methods the
genericity represented by subjectless gerundives is not a sign of their type
properties but a result of their being grounded as a virtual unitary entity

article what we are interested in is ascertaining the difference between meto
nymy and zone activation and their roles in the rise of result nominals from
different types of nominalizations
zone activation and metonymy are frequently discussed notions in
langacker s cgrelated publications langacker b    
 these notions seen in  and  seem to be intricately connected
while  is a typical instance of zone activation  is a clear example of
metonymy in the former we observe the profileactivezone discrepancy
because the profiled portion of your dog is actually your dog s teeth  instead of
your dog s teeth  however your dog active zone plays the trajector role in the
relationship leading to a discrepancy between the two your dog s teeth is
cognitively activated by virtue of linguistic context  is a case of metonymy
where the red shirts exhibits a reference shift from a physical entity to another
characteristic associated with it ie a sports team
 your dog bit my cat 
langacker  
 the red shirts won the match 
geeraerts and peirsman  
the concept of metonymy becomes more prominent in langacker s later work
he   claims that  grammar is basically metonymic in that the
information explicitly coded does not itself establish the precise connections
apprehended by the speaker and hearer in using an expression he then
emphasizes the connection between zone activation and metonymy in multiple
publications overall langacker   argues that profileactivezone
discrepancy is a special case of metonymy 
unfortunately langacker does not always clearly distinguish between meto
nymy and zone activation and other scholars interpret these notions differently

examples must be situated somewhere between metonymy and zone activation

download date    amconfusion in our analysis we would like to clarify what we mean when we use
metonymy and zone activation
we adopt the view of geeraerts and peirsman  they argue that zone
activation is a completely different phenomenon than metonymy based on the
observation that there is a lack of nec essity of the reference shift in zone
activation while this is required for typical metonymy such as 
additionally in zone activation the p rofiled portion and its active zone may
not be interchangeable in a certain grammatical context while a metonymi
cally shifted expression is almost alway s interchangeable with its original
expression as shown in  the profiled thing your dog s teeth i si n c o m p a 
tible with the verb bite because it requires a volitional subject the predicate
bit the cat is only compatible with the active zone your dog  by contrast 
and  show that both the red shirts and the team a r ec o m p a t i b l ew i t ht h e
same predicate barcelona   ma intains a similar position by stating
that some instances like your dog bit me are doubtfully metonymicsince it
is difficult to claim that the dog st e e t h are perspectivized from the dog 
according to him  shows a contrast with  in which united states is
clearly perspectivized from america 
  your dog s teeth bit my cat

 america will prevail over terrorism

although there are some borderline cases we believe the observations and
claims made by the aforementioned sch olars are valid following their ela
borated definitions of zone activati on and metonymy we use the term meto
nymy when there is a reference shift and the shifted sense is still compatible
with the predicate zone activation by contrast does not require a reference

this type of separation between the two notions is on a par with paradis s

perhaps the rise of new meanings of viewing and hearings in  and  can be
accounted for by the subevent and complex event metonymical pattern
described by peirsman and geeraerts   this pattern according to
the authors comprises two actions events or processes one of which is chongwon park and bridget park

download date    amconceptualized as a part of the other  in examples  and  viewing and
hearings are reified subevents that are parts of complex events eg hearings in
 includes the action of physical hearing but that is only a part of the
complex process that includes other court activities nevertheless the speaker
picks out one subevent from a complex event to refer to the complex event as a
whole
here we would like to emphasize that we are not claiming that suffixes
exhibit metonymy which is different from janda s     v i e wo nm e t o n y m y
and word formation rather as extens ively argued by brdar and brdarszabo 
 in response to janda  a metonymic shift does operate on a whole
d e r i v e dw o r da sas o u r c e  viewing in  gains a new meaning not because of
the  ingaffix but because of the metonymic shift facilitated by the newly
formed word viewing  this shift is possible due to the choice of a subevent of
a complex event
although the diachronic development of result nominals is beyond the
scope of the present article it is also worth noting that many of the result
nominals presented in this section are strongly lexicalized forms over time
this type of lexicalization is not available for all nominalizations at least not
to the same degree this means many of these highly lexicalized nominaliza
tions have been shaped by usage especially when they are highly frequent
naturally then zone activation and metonymy are not only processes that guide
the synchronic interpretation of nominals but also important driving forces in
the diachronic semantic development
 converted nominals
conversion within the context of metonymy has been discussed by many scho
lars notably dirven  kvecses and radden  radden and kvecses
 and schnefeld  radden and kvecses  argue that ntov
and vton nominalization conversions can be seen as two complementary
morphological processes leading to the two types of reversible metonymies 
radden and kvecses   in schnefeld s   interpretation of
radden and kvecses this means that the ntov conversion facilitates the
whole event for participants metonymy whereas the vton conversion
facilitates the participants for the whole event metonymy schnefeld
however disagrees with this treatment of conversion she claims that conversion
is a special case of metonymy and not all conversions should be considered
metonymies we believe schnefeld s point is valid particularly in the case of v
ton converted nominals as shown in cognitive grammar and english nominalization

gave me a kick in the butt that inspired me to take control of my health

b this evening as always there will be four events a run a jump a
throw and an agility drill 
denver post 
the converted noun kick in a is identical in its content to its base verb and
run jump  and throw in b have the same content as their base verbs in both
cases these nominals denote a reified relationship between two things exhibit
ing maximal transparency between pre and postconversion these nominals
created by vton conversions do not show a profileactivezone discrepancy nor
do they facilitate a noticeable metonymic shift other than the general shift from
the activity in general to a specific single act of performing the activity which is
observed not only in this particular case but also in action nominalizations in
general
langacker   notes that nominalization does not add anything to the
conceptual content of the verb the semantic contribution of nominalization is
limited to profiling an aspect of construal  by contrast he views the ntov
conversion as generally accompanied by the addition of conceptual content 
langacker   what langacker means by nominalization is not limited to
conversion only since he is discussing deverbal result nominals like explosion 
we cannot fully agree with langacker in that as we observed some nominali
zations seem to add some conceptual content such as assignment  which
exhibits added content in addition to simply something assigned  however the
vton conversion seems to support langacker s claim it does not add anything
to the conceptual content other than some changes in profiling although the
issue warrants further exploration the data presented here and elsewhere seem
to support the view that vton converted nominals generally do not facilitate a
metonymic shift other than the general shift mentioned above
one final note on conversion many vton conversions have a genuine
resultative interpretation as illustrated in as one of the reviewers of this
article pointed out offer show  and catch have a resultative interpretation
sometimes conversions profile the agent trajector as in the cook in d and
the instrumental landmark as in the clasp in e
the conversions in  qualify for episodic nominalizations that profile a region whose
constitutive entities are the component states of a process langacker  
we thank one reviewer who pointed this out with the examples provided in  chongwon park and bridget park

c hesa good catch 
dthe cook made scrumptious meals for homeless people 
e you don t have to worry about messing with the clasp 
these examples belong to the simplest type of nominalization in terms of
langacker   in this type nominalization occurs by shifting the profile
of a verb to a nominal where the nominal can be either a trajector as in d or
a landmark as in e similar to other cases of conversions no new content is
added to the base verb s conceptual content the nominalization occurs through
the shift of profiling
 conclusion
throughout this article we demonstrated that generalizations proposed by
alexiadou and grimshaw  are too strong to capture the flexible nature
of event result and gerundive nominalizations although these are generally
agreedupon observations at least in the formal linguistics enterprise in fact
many grammatical constructs often treated as infelicitous by previous research
ers are observed in naturallyoccurring discourses we observed that event
nominals exhibit great similarities to gerundive nominalizations in that both of
them utilize the speaker s ability to construe an event as a masslike entity be
that as it may they are different concerning the grounding strategies they adopt
while event nominals and the ingofgerundives adopt all grounding strategies
clausal nominalizations permit only two strategies indirect grounding through a
reference point and grounding by maximal extension event nominals and ing
nominals also contrast in their result nominal uses we observed that result
nominals with ationment or other similar affixes arise due to zone activation
or a metonymic shift by contrast  ingaffixed result nominals tend to be created
only through a metonymic shift here we would like to emphasize that these are
just tendencies we observed with a limited set of data instead of a principled
guideline vton converted nominals are different from the two aforementioned
cases neither zone activation nor a metonymic shift other than a general shift
observed in nominalizations is utilized in conversion in that sense converted
nominals exhibit the most transparent case among the three
this article was a small attempt to develop a uniform analysis of event
result and gerundive nominals from a cg perspective as mentioned in thecognitive grammar and english nominalization

download date    amoverview section of this article these topics have been thoroughly examined
from various formal linguistics perspectives it is somewhat surprising that
relatively little attention has been paid to these phenomena within the purview
of cognitive linguistics a more surprising finding is that formal linguists and
cognitive linguists do not seem to communicate enough in dealing with these
phenomena although both groups provide good insight and can learn from
each other s research we tried to incorporate these two groups views with the
hope that understanding each other s view will enhance our understanding
without respect to our theoretical persuasions
acknowledgements
the authors would like to express their deep gratitude to the three reviewers of
this article who provided valuable comments and suggestions to improve it a
small portion of this article was presented by the first author at the th uk
cognitive linguistics conference held at bangor university in july  the
first author thanks the audience members who were present at the session and
provided insightful and thoughtprovoking questions and comments
particularly he acknowledges suzanne kemmer klausuwe panther and
linda thornburg both authors would like to thank their colleagues at the
university of minnesota duluth umd who read various earlier versions of
this paper becky boyle william salmon dan turner and liz wright this
research was supported by the dean s excellence funds of the umd college of
liberal arts the authors thank dean sue maher for her generous support after
submitting this article the authors received a copy of rochelle lieber s book
lieber  makes many similar observations to ours concerning nominaliza
tions although her approach is remarkably different from theirs the authors
would like to point out that the lack of the discussion on lieber  is due to
the publication timing not because of the lack of importance of her
contribution
